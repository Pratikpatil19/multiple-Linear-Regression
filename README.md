# Diabetes Dataset - Linear Regression

This code demonstrates a simple linear regression model applied to the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn.

## Description

The code performs the following steps:

1. Loads the diabetes dataset using `datasets.load_diabetes`.
2. Selects a single feature for simplicity.
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Creates a Linear Regression model using `LinearRegression`.
5. Trains the model using the training data.
6. Makes predictions on the testing data.
7. Evaluates the model using mean squared error and R-squared score.
8. Visualizes the results with a scatter plot and the regression line.
